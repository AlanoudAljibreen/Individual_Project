But if one has a date, dinner or lunch then better to carry it along with everytime. I had to put it on again just after having my lunch at office.

1010793,I love kay beauty... I was waiting impatiently to buy this lipstick. I saved money and finally got it... Yayy... But the yay didn't last long. Firstly.. I didn't like the packaging. The monogram side is good but the end part feels like cheap plastic. The next is the cupid bow applicator. They said it's for easy application but instead it becomes very difficult to apply and lipstick smudges everytime and even gets transferred to the lipstick tube while applying which is eww.. It's absolutely not transferproof but can't really expect that from a cream lipstick so that's ok. The only thing I totally love is the shade... Omg... The colour it's so pigmented and bright.. instantly lifts up you mood and adds glam to your face even without makeup. Overall I loved the lipstick but would not buy another shade unless it's atleast 30% discount 😂,neutral,6/9/2021 21:56,4,Kay Beauty Matte Drama Long Stay Lipstick,positive,positive,positive
